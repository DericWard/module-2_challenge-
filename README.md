Assignment for module 2: Personal profile site

## Description: A portfolio site to showcase the owner's projects as well as providing contact info, an About section and a Resume section (currently a placeholder).
The app has been written with semantic HTML and makes us of a CSS Variable in css/style.css, it also makes use of CSS FlexBox and CSS Grid. The Work section provides images of the owner's projects. These images are clickable and once clicked, take the viewer/user to that particular app running live on a github.io Pages site.
Both the HTML and CSS is commented to aid modification in the future.

## The motivation behind this project was to gain more familiarity with HTML, CSS, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS Variables, Media queries for responsive layouts and using both GitHub and github.io via GitHub Pages.

## This project satisfied the requirement for Assignment 2 of the Front End Developer Bootcamp run by edX.

## Feel free to use this app, it is licensed under the MIT licence.

## Tests: This is a simple app, tests include ensuring all of the links work and that each of the main content images are clickable and take the user to a live running version of the app/project they have selected to view. There is also an email link at the bottom of the app which should open and address an email for contact purposes - this is assuming you have an email client configured on the device you are using to access the above app.
